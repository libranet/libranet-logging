# Github Code Owners File
#
# About this file:
# https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners
#
# Notes:
#   - Inline comments are supported.
#   - File-location must be one of: /CODEOWNERS, /docs/CODEOWNERS, /.github/CODEOWNERS
#   - Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
#   - Order is important. The last matching pattern takes the most precedence.
#
# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.
# Unless a later match takes precedence, these will be requested for review when someone opens a pull request.
